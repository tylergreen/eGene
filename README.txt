Basic Genetic Algorithms with Erlang

Involves a Tree Language based on Tuples, and evaluator, and tree
manipulation functions.

Goal is to become more experienced with Erlang and do a cool project
in parallel.

To Do:

Build competition Environment
Abstract away code so functions can be arbitrary, user supplied
Population Management, Mating Seasons, Natural Selection etc. 
Graphical/Visualization tools would be cool
Find Better Application/Example  -- needs closure property so programs
  are all composable

Contemplate Divide and Conquer tree walking/zipping paradigm?
